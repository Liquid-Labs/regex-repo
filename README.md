# regex-repo

Collection of JS regular expressions.

# Notes

This project is [cross-hosted on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/liquid-labs/regex-repo)
which does an excellent job of integrated CI. We use Github for issue management
and generally treat it as the primary home because it is the larger network.
